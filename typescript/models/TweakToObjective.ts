 * A tweak to objective defines additional optimization criteria. Without any tweak, the standard optimization goal is to plan as many transports as possible with as few vehicles as possible. 
 *  * `AVOID_INTERSECTIONS` - The focus of this approach is to avoid intersections of edges, where an edge is a straight line drawn between two consecutive stops in a route. The number of routes may be higher compared to the standard optimization goal. 
 *  * `IGNORE_MINIMIZATION_OF_NUMBER_OF_ROUTES` - With this tweak, the number of vehicles used in a plan, and thus the number of routes, is not minimized.
