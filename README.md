Clients for the Route Optimization API (Version 1.7.1)

Text
Using client classes makes it easier and more convenient to integrate the API into an existing programming environment. We provide here clients for Java, C# and TypeScript. Alternatively you can generate the clients yourself by using this [tutorial](https://developer.dev.myptv.com/Tutorials/General/clientGeneration.htm).

Please refer to our [Route Optimization API](https://developer.dev.myptv.com/Documentation/Route%20Optimization%20API/QuickStart.htm) documentation.
